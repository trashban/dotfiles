# current dotfiles for my thinkpad-p14 (main laptop)
## (as a first year unsw cs student)
i've used my fair share of distributions such as void-linux, fedora etc but i always (for some reason) go back to arch-linux.

currently, im utilising hyprland and waybar (extremely basic ik) for a simple and efficient workflow.
this setup utilises 'stow', a symlink manager to easily direct the configuration files towards its approriate location (typicaly .config/...).

eventually i'll create a bash script which automatically syncs all my dotfiles online to prevent losign them again (at the time of writing this, this is my third time losing my waybar config in one month....) but that's for later.
