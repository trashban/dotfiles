# dotfiles for PC + thinkpad-p14 as a unsw cs student
i've used my fair share of distributions such as void-linux, fedora etc but arch is easily the simplest for me.

my current setup is to use river and waybar to keep it simple and functional.

you can easily use stow, the gnu symlink manager to easily direct the configuration files towards its approriate location (typicaly .config/...).
eventually ill make my own program which directs it in my own way, but thats for another day.
