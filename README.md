# dotfiles for PC + thinkpad-p14 as a cs student
i've used my fair share of distributions (void-linux, fedora etc) but gentoo, nixos and arch are my favourites.

my current setup is a bloated nixos + hyprland setup.

you can use stow to easily direct the configuration files towards its approriate location (typicaly .config/...).

if i stick with nixos, ill eventually migrate more towards a home-manager setup but i dont really care atm.
